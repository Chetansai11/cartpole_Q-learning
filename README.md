# CartPole Q-Learning

This repository implements a reinforcement learning solution for solving the CartPole-v1 environment using Q-learning. The CartPole problem is a classic benchmark problem in reinforcement learning, where the goal is to balance a pole on a moving cart.

## Environment Setup

To get started, you need to set up the necessary environment and install dependencies.

### 1. Install Anaconda (Optional)

You can use Anaconda to manage your Python environment. If you haven't already installed Anaconda, you can download and install it from the official website: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual

### 2. Install Dependencies

Create a new environment in Anaconda and install the required packages:

```bash
conda create -n cartpole_qlearning python=3.8
conda activate cartpole_qlearning
```

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install gymnasium[all] numpy matplotlib
```

This installs `gymnasium` (the library used for the CartPole environment), `numpy`, and `matplotlib` for visualization.

## Running the Training

To train the Q-learning agent to solve the CartPole environment, run the following script:

```bash
python cartpole_train.py
```

This will start training the agent using Q-learning. The training process involves iterating over multiple episodes and learning the best policy to balance the pole.

The Q-table will be saved after training as `q_table.pkl`, which can be used for evaluation.

## Running the Test

Once the training is completed, you can test the trained agent by running the following script:

```bash
python cartpole_test.py
```

This will load the trained Q-table (`q_table.pkl`) and visualize the agent’s performance in the CartPole environment.

## Hyperparameters

The following hyperparameters are used in the Q-learning algorithm:

- `LEARNING_RATE`: The rate at which the Q-values are updated (default: 0.1).
- `DISCOUNT`: The discount factor for future rewards (default: 0.95).
- `EPISODES`: The number of training episodes (default: 60,000).
- `epsilon`: The exploration rate, which decreases over time as the agent learns.
- `epsilon_decay_value`: The rate at which epsilon decays.

## Q-Learning Algorithm

The Q-learning algorithm used in this project works as follows:

1. Initialize a Q-table with random values.
2. For each episode:
   - The agent interacts with the environment.
   - The agent chooses actions based on an epsilon-greedy policy.
   - The Q-table is updated using the Q-learning formula based on the observed rewards.
3. The epsilon value decreases over time to shift from exploration to exploitation.
